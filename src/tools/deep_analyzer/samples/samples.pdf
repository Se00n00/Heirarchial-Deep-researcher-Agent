Hiring Manager Google Operations Center Bangalore, India
Subject: Application for Project Management - Operations Apprenticeship (Job Req JR2602)
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Project Management - Operations
Apprenticeship at the Google Operations Center. My graduation year is 2026, and I am
completing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in AI/ML from the University
of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun. The prospect of applying my technical
background to a career in operational project management is a key motivation for my
application.
Throughout my academic and professional career, I have consistently taken on leadership
positions that required end-to-end project coordination and strategic planning. As a
Software Development Intern at the Institute of Particle and Nuclear Studies (IPNS), I
contributed to the Belle & Belle II projects by developing command-line tools for
BelleRawDirac. This role required me to manage milestones, streamline distributed
computing workflows, and collaborate with international researchers to ensure timely
stakeholder communication. Similarly, as a Project Intern at IBM, I led the full lifecycle of a
deep learning initiative, organizing team workflows and presenting progress reports to
stakeholders to ensure project success. My leadership abilities were further cemented as a
team lead on a UKTECH Hackathon project, and throughout my academic career as a class
representative and as the Head Boy of my school.
I am particularly drawn to this apprenticeship because it combines hands-on project
experience with formal training in project management principles. The opportunity to work
with Google Operations Center's data-driven approach and diverse teams aligns perfectly
with my aspiration to build a career in this field. My problem-solving abilities, honed from
building complex AI systems, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager for the opportunity to learn from your
team and contribute to your operational initiatives.
Sincerely,
Pratham Kumar Srivastav
